Hello,

This software includes some research as well as a django application.

In order to access the django application, navigate from the current directory to:

"django/HyperDrive"

After navigating to the above folder, you need to run this command on your terminal:

"python manage.py runserver"

If this command give errors, one of the requirements for running the django application are missing.

Requirements (these can be installed in a virtual environment or on the whole system):
1. python 2.7.9
2. Django 1.8.5

that's all folks, Hope you enjoy the application !
